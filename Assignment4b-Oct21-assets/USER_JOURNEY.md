   - Each deadline is automatically organized chronologically

7. **Tracking Progress**

   - For "Assignment 4b: Frontend Complete", he changes the status from "Not Started" to "In Progress" using the dropdown
   - The deadline's left border turns yellow to indicate work in progress
   - After completing his work, he marks it as "Done"
   - The completed deadline shows with a strikethrough, grayed out appearance, and moves to the end of the list

8. **Viewing All Deadlines Across Courses**

   - Tim clicks "All Deadlines" in the navigation bar
   - He sees a unified view of all his deadlines from both courses

9. **Filtering and Sorting Deadlines**

   - In the All Deadlines view, Tim uses the filter bar to:
     - Filter by course (e.g., only 6.1040 deadlines)
     - Filter by status (e.g., only "In Progress" deadlines)
     - Filter by time (e.g., "Next 7 Days")
   - He sorts deadlines by "Date: Latest First" to see what's coming up furthest out
   - He clicks "Clear Filters" to see everything again
   - Completed ("Done") deadlines always appear at the end of the list

10. **Using Calendar View**

    - Tim clicks the "ðŸ“… Calendar" toggle button
    - He sees all his deadlines displayed on an interactive monthly calendar
    - Color-coded dots indicate deadline status:
      - ðŸ”´ Red: Not Started
      - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: In Progress
      - ðŸ”µ Royal Blue: Overdue
      - âš« Gray: Completed
    - The calendar legend explains the color system
    - When Tim clicks on a date, he sees all deadlines for that day in a panel on the right
    - Each deadline shows its course badge, title, due time, status dropdown, and edit button
    - Overdue deadlines are clearly marked with an "Overdue" badge
    - Tim can change deadline status or edit details directly from the calendar view
    - He uses the month navigation arrows to plan ahead

11. **Managing Workload**
    - Tim can see at a glance which deadlines are overdue (blue border and "Overdue" badge)
    - He can see which assignments are in progress (yellow left border)
    - He can see which are not started (red left border)
    - He can see which are completed (grayed out with strikethrough)
    - Both the list view and calendar view keep him informed of his schedule
    - He can delete deadlines if they're cancelled or duplicates

### Outcome

- View deadlines in both list format (with advanced filtering/sorting) and calendar format
- Edit courses and deadlines as information changes
- See his entire semester at a glance using the calendar view
- Filter and sort to focus on specific courses, statuses, or time periods
