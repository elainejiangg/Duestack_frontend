2. **Pause briefly** after clicks to show the UI responding
3. **If you make a mistake**, just start over - it's only 2 minutes
4. **Don't worry about perfection** - this is a progress check, not a final demo
5. **Practice once** before recording to get timing right
6. **Keep your mouse movements smooth** - don't wave the cursor around
