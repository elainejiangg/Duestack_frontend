## User Journey: Tim Manages MIT Course Deadlines

**User:** Tim, an MIT junior taking 6.1040 and 6.3700

**Goal:** Organize and track deadlines across multiple courses

### Journey Steps:

1. **Account Creation**

   - Tim visits DueStack and clicks "Register"
   - He enters his name (Tim The Beaver), email (timthebeaver@mit.edu), username (tim), and password
   - The system creates his account and logs him in automatically

2. **Adding Courses**

   - Tim navigates to the "Courses" page
   - He clicks "+ New Course" and creates his first course:
     - Course Code: 6.1040
     - Title: Software Design
   - He repeats this for his second course:
     - Course Code: 6.3700
     - Title: Introduction to Probability
   - Both courses appear in a clean grid view

3. **Managing Deadlines for 6.1040**

   - Tim clicks "View Deadlines" on the 6.1040 course card
   - He clicks "+ New Deadline" and adds:
     - Title: Assignment 4b: Frontend Checkin
     - Due Date: October 21, 2025, 11:59 PM
     - Source: Manual Entry
   - He adds another deadline:
     - Title: Assignment 4c: MVP Complete
     - Due Date: October 28, 2025, 11:59 PM
     - Source: Manual Entry
   - The deadlines appear sorted by due date with the nearest deadline first

4. **Managing Deadlines for 6.3700**

   - Tim goes back to Courses and clicks "View Deadlines" on 6.3700
   - He adds several problem set deadlines with their due dates
   - Each deadline is automatically organized chronologically

5. **Tracking Progress**

   - Tim returns to his 6.1040 deadlines
   - For "Assignment 4b: Frontend Checkin", he changes the status from "Not Started" to "In Progress" using the dropdown
   - After completing his work, he marks it as "Done"
   - The completed deadline shows with a strikethrough and grayed out appearance

6. **Managing Workload**
   - Tim can see at a glance which deadlines are overdue (red badge)
   - He can see which assignments are in progress (yellow background)
   - He can see which are completed (grayed out with strikethrough)
   - He can delete deadlines if they're cancelled or duplicates

### Outcome

Tim now has all his course deadlines organized in one place, can track his progress on each assignment, and has a clear visual system to manage his workload across multiple MIT courses.
