## 💡 Smart Filtering Logic

The filters work intelligently:

1. **Completed items always go to end** (even when sorting)
2. **Overdue filter excludes completed items** (makes sense - done items aren't really overdue)
3. **Multiple filters combine** (AND logic - deadline must match all selected filters)
4. **This Week/Month calculated from today** (dynamic, always accurate)

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Student Managing Multiple Classes:

- Filter by course to focus on one class
- Use "This Week" to see what's due soon
- Use "Overdue" to catch up on missed work

### Checking What's Done:

- Filter by "Done" status to review completed work
- Combine with course filter to see progress in specific class

### Planning Ahead:

- Use "Upcoming" to see future deadlines
- Sort by "Latest First" to see long-term planning
- Use "This Month" for monthly planning

### Daily Workflow:

- Start with "Overdue" to handle urgent items
- Then "This Week" to plan near-term work
